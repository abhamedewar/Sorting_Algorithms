# Sorting Algorithms

## Selection Sort

**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by **repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion** of the array and placing it at the beginning. The algorithm divides the input array into two parts: the sorted portion on the left and the unsorted portion on the right.

## Bubble Sort

**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm is called "bubble sort" because the larger elements "bubble" to the end of the list during each iteration.

## Insertion Sort

**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Insertion sort takes each element and places the element in its correct position.

## Merge Sort

**Time Complexity:** O(nlogn) 

**Space Complexity:** O(n)

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges the sorted halves to obtain a fully sorted array.

## Quick Sort

**Time Complexity:** O(nlogn) 

**Space Complexity:** O(1)

Quick sort is a widely used sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer technique. It works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
