## Sorting Algorithms

### Selection Sort

**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup>)

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by **repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion** of the array and placing it at the beginning. The algorithm divides the input array into two parts: the sorted portion on the left and the unsorted portion on the right.
